# DiamondGAN: Unified Multi-Modal Adversarial Networks for MRI Sequences Synthesis
### Questions: what are the applications that *DiamondGAN* can be used for? 
Answer: With the projects with our colaborators in TUM hosipital, we used *DiamondGAN* for synthesizing missing modalities for MS and glioma patients. As mentioned in the  [miccai paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12894), the double inversion recovery (DIR) can be synthesized/well-reconstructed using FLAIR, T1 and T2. 
### Does *DiamondGAN* promise to genereate expected pathological information such as the texture of lesion or tumor? 
Answer: **You cannot invent information,** but you can combine as much information as possible from multiple sources.
